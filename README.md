------

In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers, <br>
I Promise that, **to the best of my ability and judgement**:

1. I will not produce harmful code.
2. The code that I produce will always be my best work. <br>
   I will not knowingly allow code that is defective <br>
   either in behavior or structure to accumulate.
3. I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof <br>
   that every element of the code works as it should.
4. I will make frequent, small, releases <br>
   so that I do not impede the progress of others.
5. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. <br>
   I will never degrade them.
6. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. <br>
   I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.
7. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.
8. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. <br>
   I will not make promises without certainty.
9. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.
